Nice to meet you! ☺️

My journey as a designer begins further back than I can remember. I began fostering my creativity and feeding my curiosity in any way I could when I was a child. It became pretty clear to me that studying Graphic Design would help me develop my artistic and creative side and apply it in the real world.

From that moment on I began doing some design freelance work for small companies and businesses in the city where I lived. After a while I got very interested in web and mobile design.

I strated learning on my own and then joined a Frontend Developer bootcamp for women that wanted to start working in the IT industry. I think that experience has had a huge impact in my life about how technology can have a real impact on people’s lives and the potential it has to make deep and long lasting changes in the world.

Thanks to that experience **in 2019 I took part in a documentary where I tell a little bit about my personal journey and how digital inclusion has impacted my life.**

My experience as a UI developer taught me to think about the underlying implementation process and how to apply logical thinking when designing interfaces and my experience as a UX/UI designer taught me to understand the softer side on how humans interact with digital products and meet business goals.

Over those years I gathered a set of skills that made me a better designer— I strengthened my user research & design thinking skills, experienced working in fast-paced growing startup, collaborated closely in making design decisions based on business value and implementing digital solutions that can be accessible by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

I’m interested in innovation-driven companies with a strong collaborative culture that promote an inclusive and diverse environment to work.
